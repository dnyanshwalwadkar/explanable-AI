# Project Name: Auto-Encoding Explanations Library (AEE-Lib)

## Goals and Objectives:

1. Develop a Python library that generates human-readable explanations for internal representations of deep learning models, enabling users to understand the decision-making process and the reasoning behind the model's output.
2. Provide support for a variety of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), transformers, and other popular architectures.
3. Develop a user-friendly API that allows users to easily generate and customize explanations for their models.
4. Offer multiple explanation techniques and methods, catering to the specific requirements of different models and tasks.
5. Provide clear and concise documentation, including examples and tutorials, to make the library accessible to users with various levels of expertise.

## Supported Deep Learning Models:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Widely used for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing tasks.
2. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) - Advanced RNN architectures that alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, improving performance on long sequences.
3. Transformers - Powerful architectures used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, question-answering, and sentiment analysis.
Other popular architectures and variants, such as ResNets, DenseNets, and attention mechanisms, depending on user demand and advancements in the field.
